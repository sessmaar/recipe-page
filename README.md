## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me refine my skills in responsive table styling and list customization. One of the main challenges was adding separator lines to the nutrition table while keeping the layout clean.

I learned how to use border-collapse to manage table borders effectively and specific pseudo-classes like :last-child to control styling on specific rows and cells.

I also learned how to style list markers (bullets and numbers) directly using the ::marker pseudo-element, which allowed me to change their color without wrapping the content in spans.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

Accessibility standards (ARIA labels) for complex tables.

Refactoring CSS into partials or using a preprocessor like SASS for larger projects.

Further optimizing images for different screen sizes using the <picture> tag.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Table Styling - This helped me understand border-collapse.

CSS Tricks - ::marker - Great guide on how to style list bullets.
